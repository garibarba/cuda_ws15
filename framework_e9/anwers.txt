6. With tau too large the image turns noisy and then goes black.
With very large times, the image becomes of uniform colour (average colour).

7. It is equivalent.

8. The inverse of the maximum preserves the edges and smoothes inside.
The exponential potentiates update for small gradients and reduces the update big gradients.
It has the same effect as the first, but stronger.
Good values in both cases for lighthouse are -tau 0.001 -N 500 -epsilon 0.01
